### Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC)

</div>

The Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) was established to meet the growing demand for effective transnational dispute resolution services in Asia and beyond. Due to Singapore’s strategic location, the SICC is well-placed to provide a trusted neutral venue in support of the diverse Belt and Road Initiatives as our world-class judiciary is known for its efficiency, competence and integrity. The SICC bench comprises a diverse panel of eminent international and local judges who are experienced specialist commercial judges in their own right.  An important feature of the SICC is that it allows foreign lawyers to represent parties in certain circumstances, so long as they are registered with the Court and subject themselves to a Code of Ethics.   

The SICC adopts international best practices for commercial disputes. Its procedures are flexible and may be tailored to suit parties’ preferences in several aspects. Yet, the SICC retains advantages of litigation like the availability of appeal and interim measures.  Published judgments with clear grounds of decision will also aid in future disputes of a similar nature.  And most vital in multi-party/multi-contract scenarios: the ability to join third and related parties. Finally, parties having their disputes adjudicated at the SICC will find that court fees are quite cost-effective. 

In essence, the SICC gives parties a truly unique dispute resolution option – which has been described by some as “arbitration in litigation”, combining the best practices of international arbitration with the substantive principles of international commercial law.  For more information about the SICC, please visit [http://www.sicc.gov.sg](http://www.sicc.gov.sg) or email [SICC_Development@supcourt.gov.sg](mailto:SICC_Development@supcourt.gov.sg).

The Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) is a platform for thought leadership in international dispute resolution theory, practice and policy. A research centre at the Singapore Management University Yong Pung How School of Law, SIDRA leads the way through projects, publications and events that promote dynamic and inclusive conversations on how to constructively engage with and resolve differences and disputes at global, regional and national levels. In particular, SIDRA differentiates itself through its focus on applied research that has practical impact on industry, including conducting SIMI Registered Training Programmes for mediator accreditation, and IMI-accredited training programmes for mediation advocacy.   

SIDRA conducts research on three main areas – the international dispute resolution survey (SIDRA Survey), the Singapore Convention on Mediation and the Belt and Road Initiative.  The SIDRA Survey aims to learn more about how and why businesses and lawyers make decisions about resolving cross-border commercial disputes, and deals with issues at the forefront of debate such as technology, diversity, and third-party funding.  The research on the Singapore Convention on Mediation includes key projects including ‘Singapore Convention on Mediation – A Commentary’ and ‘International and Comparative Mediation – An Asian Perspective’ which will feature comparative research on the mediation eco-systems in civil and common law systems in Asia. The research on the Belt & Road Initiative aims to contribute to the global discourse on complexities that would arise in cross-border dispute resolution under the Belt and Road Initiative.  SIDRA's BRI program aims to provide a forum for academics, practitioners, judges, and policymakers to understand the practical and multi-faceted implications of the BRI in the region and globally, and to spotlight issues relating to dispute resolution under the BRI.
